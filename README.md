# simulation_cml_violation_cia

This repository contains the code and data from the masterâ€™s thesis titled **"A Simulation Study on the Sensitivity of Causal Machine Learning Methods to Violations of the Conditional Independence Assumption"** by **Yannick Homberger** (Nov. 2024).

The purpose of this repository is to provide the code used to recreate all simulations conducted in the thesis. Below is a brief overview of the key components:

### Repository Structure:
- **`simulation_code/`**: This folder contains the core code for running the simulations.
  
- **`dgp_and_visualization.py`**: This script generates the data and runs the simulation. It also includes sections for creating visualizations such as propensity score plots and tables, which are featured in the thesis.

- **`results_visualization.py`**: This script is responsible for creating tables and visualizations that display the results of the simulation.

- **`results.csv`**: This file contains all the results from the simulation.

- **`master_thesis.pdf`**: This file contains the master thesis.
